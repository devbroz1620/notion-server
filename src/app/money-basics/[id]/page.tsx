Budgeting is the foundation of financial stability and a critical first step for anyone aiming to achieve their financial goals.

It's not just about restricting spendingâ€”it's about making smarter choices for a secure and prosperous future.

**Step 3: Set Financial Goals**

- Allocate funds for savings, investments, and debt repayment
